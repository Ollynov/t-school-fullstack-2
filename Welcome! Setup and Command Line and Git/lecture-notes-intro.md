# TIME FOR SOME FULLSTACK PROGRAMMING

The goal of this first session is to get to know each other, provide some context on what we will be building, and to see if there are certain holes in our understanding of fullstack. We will structure the course about 30% lecture, and 70% hacking, because we are firm believers that the best way to learn, is by doing. Also- in case you are solid in certain portions of the stack, yet weak on others, you can be sure to put extra emphasis on those weaker ones. The assumption is that you already know the fundamentals of programming (especially html!), so we can quickly move onwards to the interesting stuff!!

## What you will learn in this first section
* How this course will be structured
* What is fullstack?
* How to use basic commands of the Terminal
* What git is
* How git differs from github
* How to use git

### Exercise- So what is a fullstack app? 


### Our Project
We are going to be building a fullstack app, with extra emphasis on the portions that can be duplicated for any web app (authentication, responsive design, etc.). We will move rapidly, but will be covering more or less everything that constitutes a one-page CRUD app. This stands for 'CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE' - essentially we want our app to have database persistence, and functionality to actively update portions of the page as we navigate, perform actions, etc. If you can get comfortable implementing the most crucial components, you can always replace with different technologies, different APIs, different styles, etc. for the future app of your choice. We want you to get creative both during the course, and afterwards when you go home, and have this app to play around with.

We will be building a simple community blog, and as we go along, if certain parts come easy to you since they are review, please feel free to customize however you want, just don't fall behind on the current topic we are covering. We ask that you follow along more closely in the first two days where we will cover basics that should apply to any app- server setup, responsive navbar, database integration, authentication, etc. but feel free to get creative, especially during the hacking sessions!

### Some Course Themes
Some good rules of thumbs to remember during the class are:

**Google when you don't know**
There is really no way to learn fullstack programming in 4 days. Even more important than any one specific technical skill to walk away from this class with, is the ability to be resourceful. One of the secrets of engineers that non-engineers may not know, is that we hardly ever expect the code to work the first time we run it. Embrace that, and get in the habit of using stack overflow, docs, and whatever else you can quickly google search.

**Read the lectures notes before class**
Learning coding can be pretty hard at the beginning especially if you have never been exposed to it. Read the lectures notes before each classes will help you understand faster key concepts that will be taught in class.

**Ask questions!**
After you have done some research through google, don't be afraid to ask questions when you are stuck. If you don't understand something, you will most likely not be the only one. Don't hesitate to raise you hand and ask, I can't stress this enough.

**In case you feel it's 'easy'**
With so many students, from a range of backgrounds, it's impossible to make the curriculum perfect for everyone. We will be moving at a very fast pace, in case something feels 'basic' or 'easy' for you in the early stages, there is a very good chance that we will be catching up to your current knowledge base within a day, or even just a couple hours. With that said, if at any point you feel the current lecture is too much of a review for you, feel free to skip ahead! Also, feel free to customize the app your way- just because we style it a certain way or give it certain functionality, does not mean yours has to be the exactly the same. The only thing we ask is that you pass the same 'reality checks' as the rest of the class. Occasionally we will do a 'thumb check' to see if there is anyone who does not have their app at a certain point of functionality. 

**Imposter Syndrome is Real**
In case you feel lost... you're not the only one. Because of the nature of programming (oftentimes staring at a screen for prolonged times), we may be tempted to think that everyone else is just hacking away without any errors, everyone except for us. The truth is that when an experienced developer runs new code for the first time, they usually _don't expect it to work_; they know that most of the time as a developer you are fixing bugs, researching, and just "figuring it out" as you go along. Being in a state of uncertainty is a natural feeling for a developer, you just need to develop the habit of knowing that there almost always is _some_ sort of solution and path forward (even if it isn't clear). 



### Get to know each other activity! [Link to Activity](https://ibm.box.com/s/n9h9ls4eixi79co3ezo1dnw7qj2ewtzq)

### Initial Setup 
**Dependencies**

You will need to have 4 things already installed on your computers:
- Node
- NPM
- Git (almost all computers come with git already)
- Sublime Text (or similar text editor)

To check if any of the 4 are installed, you can run 'which node', and you should get the path where it is installed. Typically they are installed within our bin folder. If they are located somewhere else, no need for immediate action, but something to keep in mind. 

* [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Install NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Install Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

You also should already have an enterprise github account on * [Github](https://github.ibm.com)


**Getting our Repo Locally**

We are going to get an introduction to Shell Commands, while cloning down the remote repo that I have up and running here: LINK

* Shell Commands ([POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/)/[UNIX](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Unix_timeline.en.svg))
    * `ls` (`-t`, `-a`)
    * `pwd`
    * `mkdir`
    * `cd`
    * `touch`
    * `mv`
    * `rm`

*> Exercise: follow along with me to learn some command line basics, and let's create the repo for our project*

**Great, let's start learning some [GIT]()**
