Be sure to explore the concept of a server before going too far in depth into Node. The lecture notes are a great start, 
but you can also check out youtube, wikipedia, and this exhaustive list: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#back-end-development
Once you do move onto learn [node](https://nodejs.org/en/), try to understand some of the building blocks before moving onto Express.
Express is a no-brainer, it abstracts out a ton of the normal work that would go with Node, but there is value in understanding 
part of what goes on "under the hood." Just how jQuery doesn't do anything that javascript cannot, Express doesn't really do anything
that pure Node cannot, it just makes it much more simple. 

With those basics you should be good to go. Unlike the previous lessons, there is no expectation that you know node ahead of time, 
we will be covering most of the essential basics to get you up and running.
