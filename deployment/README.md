# Deploying to Bluemix with Git & Postgres

Deployment is generally the last stage of development (after thorough testing) and creates/replaces your public production application with a new version of your app. Deployment involves not only transferring new code to a live server, but also configuring that server to deal with your files and run your application. In the simplest terms, this means telling the server what files to execute when it receives an incoming request. Luckily, Heroku does almost all of this configuration for us.
